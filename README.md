# Learning DSP

Some very basic and crude implementation of DSP functions to test my understanding of signal processing.

Currently includes:

 * A Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) function
 * Hanning Window when performing the DFT
 * Spectral magnitude calculation

And some useful tidbits to play with it:

 * Wave file loader
 * ASCII representation of a spectrum
